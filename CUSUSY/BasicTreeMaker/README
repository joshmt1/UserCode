Release notes
--

V00-03-00 - add RA2 Leptons (requires checking out RA2 code), add PDF uncertainties (requires special code and special setup for compilation)

V00-02-04 - add some code that specifically look at the decay mode of Z0. Adds one variable to ntuple

V00-02-03 - slightly bigger revamp. remove some unused variables and add jet E and pz

V00-02-02 - added mcWeight variable for Flat samples (never made it into CVS)

V00-02-01 - identical to V00-02-00 except a bug fix in branch loosejetGenParticlePDGId

V00-02-00 - 
- change MET storage implementation slightly (to be less hard-coded and more like jets)
- Implement two muon filters from classic RA2
  	    -hopefully eliminates fake MET
	    -called passesBadPFMuonFilter and passesInconsistentMuonPFCandidateFilter
- store *all* muons instead of just global muons
- fix critical bug in gen jet info (px was stored instead of pT)
- add JEC uncertainties
- change py to store *all* jets in ntuple

V00-01-05 - add tau info

V00-01-04 - update for compatibility with JEC changes in CMSSW 386. Not backwards compatible!

V00-01-03 / low20101110 - added nTracks and fixed on SV variable definition

low20101027 - adding secondary vertex information to jets

V00-01-02 - Fix isGlobalMuonPromptTight and add electron info. Update to using SelectorUtils V00-02-24

V00-01-01 - no substantive changes

V00-01-00 - version used for first iteration of UCSB/UCR/CU sync exercise.
Known problems  -- isGlobalMuonPromptTight is useless
		-- should store more info on electrons in order to redo all ID cuts

jmt101014a - lots of fundamental changes. Add handling of multiple jet types, etc.
Will require substantial changes to analysis code.

V00-00-05 - disable some things that did not work well with data

V00-00-04b - loosen cut on uncorrected jets

V00-00-04 - add uncorrected jets

V00-00-03 - 
Add info about 'loose' jets. Add true jet flavor.

V00-00-02 - 
Adds more elegant handling of b-tagging (name of b taggers given in python).
Also add tcMET and also some MC truch info about tops.

V00-00-01 - 
used to create plots and cut flows for Julia's 16 July 2010 talk at
SUSY Hadronic Working Group meeting. For MoreMSSM (RECO in 36X),
required a hack for b-tag info (not in CVS).
